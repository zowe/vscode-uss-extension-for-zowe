# Install, Build, and Test the Extension

Developers can install the Visual Studio Code Extension for Zowe, which lets users interact with z/OS data sets on a remote mainframe instance, from a VSIX file and run system tests on the extension.

## Install to VSC from source

You can build the extension (VSIX file) from this source repository and install it to VSC.  

**Important!** Follow the [instructions for creating testProfileData.ts](#run-system-tests) before performing these steps.

### Build the extension

From your local copy of this repository, issue the following commands to create the VSIX package file from source:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run package`
   This creates a `.vsix` file in your local copy of the project.

### Install the extension to VSC

After you create a VSIX file, install the extension to VSC:

1. Navigate to the Extensions menu in Visual Studio Code and click the **...** menu on the top-left. 
2. Select Install from VSIX and select the `.vsix` file that was created by your `npm run package` command. 
3. Restart Visual Studio Code.

The extension is installed.

## Run System Tests

The following topics describe how to run system tests on the Visual Studio Code extension.

### Test Profile Data

In your copy of this repository, create a `testProfileData.ts` file in the `resources` directory. In this file, include the following text with your credentials:

```typescript
import { IProfile } from "@brightside/imperative";

export const profile: IProfile = {
    type : "zosmf",
    host: "",
    port: 0,
    user: "",
    password: "",
    rejectUnauthorized: false,
    name: "" // @NOTE: This profile name must match an existing zowe profile in the ~/.zowe/profiles/zosmf folder
};

export const normalPattern = "";
export const orPattern = "";
```

**Note:** You can copy the above example content from `./resources/testProfileData.example.ts`.

#### Normal pattern

To test the extension, the mainframe data sets under `normalPattern` must match the following structures:

- `normalPattern` + "/aDir1"
  - "/aFile1.txt"
- `normalPattern` + "/aFile2.txt"
- `normalPattern` + "/aDir2"
- `normalPattern` + "/group/aDir3"
- `normalPattern` + "/group/aDir4"
  - "/aFile3.txt"
- `normalPattern` + "/group/aDir5"
  - "/aFile4.txt"
  - "/aFile5.txt"
- `normalPattern` + "/group/aDir6"

The `./scripts` folder contains the following scripts to help you set up the required file structure. You can execute the scripts when the `ts-node` package is installed globally.

- [create-env](/scripts/create-env.ts): Creates the proper data sets on the mainframe.
- [clean-env](/scripts/clean-env.ts): Cleans up the data sets created on the mainframe.

**Note:** The scripts use the profile that you specified in `testProfileData`.

##### Execute the setup scripts

1. Issue the following command to install `ts-node` globally:

    `npm install -g ts-node`

2. Issue the following command to execute script as if it were a node script.

    `ts-node ./scripts/clean-env.ts` or `ts-node ./scripts/create-env.ts`

#### Or pattern

There is no required structure for the mainframe data sets under `orPattern`.

### Executing from VSC

1. To run the tests, open your copy of the repository in VSC, [build the extension](#build-the-extension), and open the **Debug** panel on the left.

2. From the drop-down next to the green play button, click **Integration Tests Mocha** and click the **Play** button.

  The tests run and the output goes to your VSC debug console. 

### Profile notes

- As mentioned in the example test properties file, there must be at least one valid zosmf profile corresponding to the name in your properties file.

  **Example:** When your test properties define a profile named `test-vscode-extension`, a corresponding profile should exist in the `.zowe` profiles directory of your `zowe-cli`. The profile definitions **must** be identical to allow your tests to execute properly.
